||| Core features required to perform Golden file testing.
|||
||| We provide the core functionality to run a *single* golden file test.
||| This allows the developer freedom to design the rest of the test harness.
|||
||| This was originally used as part of Idris2's own test suite and
||| the core functionality is useful for the many and not the few.
||| Please see Idris2 test harness for example usage.
|||
||| # Test Structure
|||
||| This harness works from the assumption that each individual golden test comprises of a directory with the following structure:
|||
||| + `run` a *shell* script that runs the test
||| + `expected` a file containting the expected output of `run`
|||
||| During testing, the test harness will generate an artefact named `output` and use the following command to compare them as they are:
|||
||| ```sh
|||  git diff --no-index --exit-code --word-diff=color expected output
||| ```
|||
||| If `git` fails then the runner will simply present the expected and 'given' files side-by-side.
|||
||| Of note, it is helpful if `output` was added to a local `.gitignore` instance to ensure that it is not mistakenly versioned.
|||
||| # Options
|||
||| The test harness has several options that must be set:
|||
||| + `idris2` the path of the executable we are testing.
||| + `onlyNames` the list of tests to run relative to the generated executable.
||| + `interactive` Should we update the expected file or not.
|||
||| We provide an options parser (`options`) that will take the command line arguments and constructs this for you.
|||
||| # Usage
|||
||| When compiled to an executable the expected usage is:
|||
|||```sh
|||runtests <path to executable under test> [--interactive] [--only [NAMES]]
|||```
|||
||| assuming that the test runner is compiled to an executable named `runtests`.
