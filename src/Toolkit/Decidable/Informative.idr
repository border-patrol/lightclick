||| A version of `Dec` that returns a meaningful error message as well as proof of void.
|||
||| When dealing with decidable properties for type-level computations
||| the existing `Dec` data type is useful.  However, when using
||| decidable properties interactively one cannot easily tell why a
||| property failed.  One can always encode failing cases within the
||| property itself but that is not necessarily a advantageous.
|||
||| `DecInfo` provides a data structure to capture decidable properties together with an informative error message for when the property does not hold.

   No  : (msgWhyNot : errType) -> (prfWhyNot : prop -> Void) -> DecInfo errType prop
